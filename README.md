# Approaching the challenge

When faced with this challenge I first read through the brief and took notes on the key requirements of the program. I drew out the classes I needed with a pen and paper this was to make sure I fully understood the challenge before attempting it.
I decided to use c++ programming language in visual studio to complete this challenge this is due to the way c++ handles classes as well as it being my strongest programming language.
After deciding this I started the challenge. I implemented the parts of this program one at a time, testing them throught, starting by making a simpler system that just adds up values to increasing the complexity by taking into account the discounts via "PricingRules" as well as the delivery cost. This works well for me as I can visualise each indivial part of the program as I go along.
